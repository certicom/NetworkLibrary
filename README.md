# NetworkLibrary
Network Library for games based on the SFML network module.

This library is a small module on top of the SFML one.

This allow to create clients, servers and to syncronize all the game with the least number a line possible
The behaviour of this library is inspired by the network module of Unity that is able to automatically syncronize everything taged correctly.
